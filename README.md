# ARAP_interpolation
Libigl style code for SIGGRAPH paper "As-Rigid-As-Possible Shape Interpolation" Alexa, M., Cohen-Or, D., & Levin, D. 2000.    
Now only worked in case of two 2D meshes with the same connectivity.   
Very trivial to modify arap_interpolation.cpp for making it work with 3D meshes. Have fun!
